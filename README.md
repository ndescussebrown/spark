# This repo is dedicated to the work performed as part of the final Data Pipelines 2 project for the DSTI MSc in Data Engineering

The project used some files included in the Kaggle dataset:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/corona-virus-brazil

The Goal of the project is twofold:
* To compute a new_brazil_covid19.csv file using data in brazil_covid19_cities.csv so that the structure and meaning of the data is the same as brazil_covid19.csv.
* Compare the new_brazil_covid19.csv file and provided brazil_covid19.csv file
